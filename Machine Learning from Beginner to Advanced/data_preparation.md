The two most popular approach to data quality inspection is: Data Profiling and Data visualization

## 1.1. Data Profiling

Data profiling is reviewing source data, understanding structure, content, and interrelationships, and identifying potential for data projects

Data profiling is a crucial part of

- Data warehouse and business intelligence (DW/BI) projects—data profiling can uncover data quality issues in data sources, and what needs to be corrected in ETL.
- Data conversion and migration projects—data profiling can identify data quality issues, which you can handle in scripts and data integration tools copying data from source to target. It can also uncover new requirements for the target system.
- Source system data quality projects—data profiling can highlight data that suffers from serious or numerous quality issues, and the source of the issues (e.g. user inputs, errors in interfaces, data corruption).

### 1.1.1. Data profiling involves:

- Collecting descriptive statistics like min, max, count, and sum.
- Collecting data types, length, and recurring patterns.
- Tagging data with keywords, descriptions, or categories.
- Performing data quality assessment, risk of performing joins on the data.
- Discovering metadata and assessing its accuracy.
- Identifying distributions, key candidates, foreign-key candidates, functional dependencies, embedded value dependencies, and performing inter-table analysis

### 1.1.2. Data profiling involves:
Data profiling collects statistics and meta-information about available data that provide insight into the content of data sets
